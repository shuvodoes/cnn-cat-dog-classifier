# cnn-cat-dog-classifier
CNN-based image classification model for binary classification using image augmentation techniques.

Cat vs Dog Image Classification Model
This is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model built using TensorFlow and Keras to classify images of cats and dogs. The model uses a simple architecture of convolutional layers followed by fully connected layers for binary classification.

Requirements.
Python 
TensorFlow 
Keras
NumPy
Jupyter (optional for notebook usage)
